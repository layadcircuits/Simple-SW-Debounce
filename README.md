# Simple-SW-Debounce
A simple approach to switch debouncing via software using short delays and multiple input checks.  This is not the only debounce method and neither is it the best one. However, it is very simple  and should help a novice user understand how to implement a debounce algorithm on an Arduino or  any microcontroller by software method.
